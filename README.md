# Undergraduate research:
I study for my undergraduate research that consists of studying regression models with scalar response variable and functional predictors using the fda and refund packages. Initially, data were collected from 336 pregnant women during prenatal assessments for a study by the School of Medicine of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil), and now I am using it for my study with the guidance of my professor Agatha Sacramento Rodrigues.

*The database "Base_TocoColoPerinatal.xls" is the original of this study, it contains missing data and
the prenatal evaluations are interpreted as having been made every two weeks resulting in 5 prenatal
evaluations. 

*The database "datas_igs_completas.xlsx" is the modified database.  A method of data imputation was applied in this. In addition, assessments of functional predictors were
interpreted as performed weekly, resulting in 11 evaluations in the prenatal period.

*For each approach of the study there is a "object.RData" with all the objects of the script for that
specific approach, you can choose run the entire script or just load the objects.
